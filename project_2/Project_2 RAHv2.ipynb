    "# Project 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The final project will comprise an analysis of a dataset of your choosing, using the numpy and pandas tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Push your proposal to your team's GitHub repository by 11:59PM PSDT the day before class, week of Nov 26-30.\n",
    "- Push your report to your team's GitHub repositiory by 11:59PM PDT the day after class, week of Dec 10-14.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Team\n",
    "- Form a team of 2 to 3 students.  Record your team [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BK1E7BxYBo5eVU2Vq7N6vOaKiWkZ8tRKdSukUWAp4KM/edit#gid=0).\n",
    "- Create a new GitHub respository for your team.\n",
    "- You choose your team members from among students in your section, or in exceptional cases from among students in other sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Analysis\n",
    "- This project is relatively unguided.  You will come up with your own interesting questions that you can answer using the variables in your dataset, then perform an analysis based on those questions.\n",
    "- You can analyze either an *instructor-approved dataset of your finding* or one that we have preapproved. You may join several datasets together.  For example, you might combine two datasets to answer questions like, \"Is felony crime higher in NYC after 2 days of rain?\"\n",
    "- This project emphasizes the exploratory and descriptive techniques covered in class.  Although some of you have a background in statistics, we ask that you avoid any statistical inference or other advanced techniques.  In particular, this means that you should confine your analysis to the sample of data you have, and avoid making statements about the population that the sample comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "With your team members, prepare a 1 to 2 page proposal about the questions that you intend to ask of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposal should describe ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- names of team members,\n",
    "- name of your team's GitHub repository,\n",
    "- a primary dataset you intend to analyze,\n",
    "- initial plots, figures, or tables,\n",
    "- some of the variables (column names) you intend to explore and what kind of insights you expect to glean,\n",
    "- supplemental datasets, if any, to complement your primary dataset - this means links, columns that you'll join on, etc.,\n",
    "- what you plan to cover in the final report and how you plan to organize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should be 8 or more pages (including appropriately sized figures) and describe what you found out from the data. This should focus on telling stories and explaining the narrative of the exploration and challenges associated with that. The report should not include any code - rather, all code should be included in a sub-folder in either plain python files or in jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the report, any graphs, tables, or figures should be annotated with descriptions about why they are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, using GitHub to share jupyter notebooks has proven problemmatic in the past. Be sure to create copies of notebooks when you make an edit.  As your code beccomes increasingly stable, you may find it easier to just put it into a python file and import it into a jupyter notebook as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructor Pre-Approved Datasets\n",
    "- [Titanic passenger data](http://campus.lakeforest.edu/frank/FILES/MLFfiles/Bio150/Titanic/TitanicMETA.pdf)\n",
    "- [Political Ad Archive](http://politicaladarchive.org/data/)\n",
    "- [Global warming data (Berkeley Earth) - use the *time series section* ](http://berkeleyearth.org/data/)\n",
    "- [US Gov't Web Logs](https://analytics.usa.gov/)\n",
    "- [Parks graffitti report (St. Paul)](https://information.stpaul.gov/City-Infrastructure/Parks-Graffiti-Report-Dataset/gcu2-spkd) \n",
    "- [The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database](http://www.nuforc.org) will be challenging but fun since the reports are not uniform and are split across multiple tables that you may have to scrape.\n",
    "- The airlines dataset that we explored in asynch and any subsets thereof (so you may choose to analyze several years for example). Obviously, a repeat of the analysis performed in asynch would not be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Datasets\n",
    "**REMEMBER NONE OF THESE HAVE BEEN APPROVED, YOU HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR INSTRUCTOR TO GET THEM APPROVED.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Historical Weather Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn)\n",
    "  - This can be a bit difficult to figure out what to download. [In this discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10465342) there are some pointers on how to get at it. This dataset is pre-approved as a **supplemental** dataset, but see your instructor if you would like this to be the primary dataset.\n",
    "- [Data is Plural](http://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive)\n",
    "  - The pre-approved datasets come primarily from here. Pretty extensive list.\n",
    "- [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)\n",
    "  - Awesome list that's worth saving for future reference. Be sure to actually download and explore the data before proposing one to your instructor.  There are some awesome datasets here like the NYC taxi dataset.\n",
    "- [Data.gov](http://data.gov/)\n",
    "  - All gov't data, which is good!\n",
    "- [Reddit/r/Datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets)\n",
    "  - Community-generated and definitely some potential for good datasets. Worth searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To get a dataset approved ...\n",
    "1. Send your instructor a description of the data, including a link to the exact dataset or a place from where it can be downloaded with one click without registering or anything like that. \n",
    "    - The data needs to be in a raw text file format like json or csv (or at least very easy to convert to that format).\n",
    "    - Report the size of the dataset or the subset you plan on looking at. This is **not** a big data project.\n",
    "2. Show that you've done some preliminary research and that there will be enough interesting questions to ask of the data. This should include column names and information about any missing data.\n"
