    "\n",
    "Please design two classes in this notebook as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Please create a class called **PlayingCard**. This class should have: <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"rank\" that takes a value of \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\", or \"A\" <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"suit\" that takes a value of \"♠\" \"♥\" \"♦\" or \"♣\". (If you don't know how to make these characters you can cut and paste from this block)<br>  \n",
    "- An __init__ function that:\n",
    "    -  Accepts as parameters a specific rank (as integer or string) and suit (as a string).\n",
    "    -  Gives an appropriate response when a rank or suit is not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Please create a class called **Deck**.  This class should have: <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"cards\", that holds a list of PlayingCard objects. <br>\n",
    "- An __init__ function that: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - By default stores a full deck of 52 playing card (with proper numbers and suits) in the \"cards\" list. Each cards will be  of the class PlayingCard above<br>\n",
    "    - Allows the user to specify a specific suit (of the 4 - \"♠\" \"♥\" \"♦\" or \"♣\").  In this case, the program should only populate the deck with the 13 cards of that suit.\n",
    "    - After the cards object is initialized, call the \"shuffle_deck()\" function (below).<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A \"shuffle_deck()\" function that randomly changes the order of cards in the deck.<br>\n",
    "    - You can import the random library to 'shuffle' the deck: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/random.html\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"deal_card(card_count)\" function that removes the first card_count cards from the deck and returns them as a list.<br>\n",
    "    - Make sure this function gives an appropriate response when the deck is out of cards.\n",
    "    \n",

In row 0, there is one position a marble can be in (labeled 0), in row 1, there are two positions (labeled 0 and 1), and so forth.  Each time the marble bounces from one row to the next, there is a 50% probability it bounces left and a 50% probability it bounces right. \n",

    "- ```time_step``` - This method should cause all Marbles in Galton's box to bounce to the next row, dropping left or right with equal probability.  When a marble reaches row N-1 at the bottom of the box, it should not move any more.  Note that you should simply allow marbles to occupy the same position (instead of working out a system to prevent a Marble from entering a position if another Marble is already there).\n",

    "## Part 5 - Sorting Marbles\n",
    "\n",
    "In a particular board game, there is exactly one row and it comprises N spaces, numbered 0 through N - 1 from left to right. There are also N marbles, numbered 0 through N - 1, initially placed in some arbitrary order. After that, there are two moves available that only can be done one at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Switch: Switch the marbles in positions 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Rotate: Move the marble in position 0 to position N - 1, and move all other marbles one space to the left (one index lower).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to arrange the marbles in order, with each marble i in position i.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Write a class, **MarblesBoard**, to represent the game above. The class should be initialized with a particular sequence of Marbles.  \n",
    "- Write an ```__init__``` function that takes a starting sequence of marbles (the number of each marble listed in the positions from 0 to N - 1). (Notice in the sequence all the marbles are different numbers and are sequential numbered but not in order!)\n",
    "- Next, write switch() and rotate() methods to simulate the player's moves as described above. \n",
    "- Write a method, is_solved(), that returns True if the marbles are in the correct order, False otherwise.\n",
    "- Additionally, write ```__str__ and __repr__``` methods to display the current state of the board. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your class should behave like the following example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board = MarblesBoard((3,6,7,4,1,0,8,2,5)) \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 6 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "6 3 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.rotate() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 6 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "7 3 4 1 0 8 2 5 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Write a second class, **Solver**, that actually plays the MarblesGame. \n",
    "- Your class will take a MarblesBoard in its initializer. \n",
    "- Write a solve() method that repeatedly calls the switch() and rotate() methods of the given MarblesBoard until the game is solved. You should print the state of the board after each move.  Additionally, print out the total number of moves at the end. Remember, you can only do one switch or one rotate per step!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to come up with your own algorithm for solving the marbles game.  Before you write your solve() method, you may want to practice solving some small versions of the marbles game yourself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board2 = MarblesBoard((1,3,0,2))\n",
    ">>> solver = Solver(board2)\n",
    ">>> solver.solve()\n",
    "1 3 0 2 \n",
    "3 0 2 1 \n",
    "0 2 1 3 \n",
    "2 1 3 0 \n",
    "1 2 3 0 \n",
    "2 3 0 1 \n",
    "3 0 1 2 \n",
    "0 1 2 3 \n",
    "total steps: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Solver does not need to follow the fastest possible running time but you should strive to make it reasonably efficient.   \n",
    "\n",
    "You may be interested to know that your program is a variation of a well-known sorting algorithm called bubble sort.  Bubble sort would normally be used on a list of items, not on a rotating track, but adapting your algorithm to this setting would be straight-forward."
