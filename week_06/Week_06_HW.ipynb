    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes a Scrabble rack as a command-line argument and prints all valid Scrabble words that can be constructed from that rack, along with their Scrabble scores, sorted by score. Valid Scrabble words are provided in the data source below. A Scrabble rack is made up of 2 to 7 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the requirements for the program:\n",
    "- This needs to be able to be run as a command line tool as shown below (not an input statement!)\n",
    "- Name the python file: `scrabble.py`\n",
    "- Include a function called `score_word` in a separate module. Import this function into your main solution code\n",
    "- Allow anywhere from 2-7 character tiles (letters A-Z) to be inputted \n",
    "- Do not restrict the number of same tiles (e.g., a user is allowed to input ZZZZZQQ)\n",
    "- Output the **total** list of valid Scrabble words that can be constructed from the rack as (score, word) tuples, sorted by score as shown below\n",
    "- Then output 'Total number of words:' and the total number\n",
    "- You need to handle input errors from the user and suggest what that error might be caused by and how to fix it (i.e., a helpful error message)\n",
    "- Implement wildcards as either `*` or `?`. A wildcard character can take any value A-Z. There can be a total of **only** two wild cards in any user input (that is, one of each character: one `*` and one `?`). Only use the `*` and `?` as wildcard characters.\n",
    "- Wildcard characters are scored as 0 points, just like in the real Scrabble game\n",
    "- Your program should take less than two minutes to run with 2 wildcards in the input - if it takes more time than that then your algorithm is not optimized very well!\n",
    "- Write docstrings for the functions and puts comments in your code.\n",
    "- You should only use the Python standard library in this assignment.  However, any function in the standard library is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra Credit (+10 points):\n",
    "Allow a user to specify that a certain letter has to be at a certain location. Your program must work without it so this is completely optional. For the extra credit, locations of certain letters must be specified at the command line, and may not be some sort of user prompt.  Please put comments and a sample of how to run your extra credit in the extra credit cell of this notebook below - it is the last cell.\n",

    "- If you don't know what \"scrabble\" is or the basic background of the game please look it up online!\n",

If you get stuck, go back to thinking about the problem rather than trying to fix lots of errors at the code level.\n",
    "- If you keep getting stuck, then check out: https://openhatch.org/wiki/Scrabble_challenge. This is where we got the idea for this assignment and it provides some helpful tips for guiding you along the way.  However, we would recommend that you try to implement this first before looking at the hints on the website.\n",
