    "## General Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though your final submission must be individual .py files, it may be helpful to first solve the problems in this jupyter notebook, then translate the files into .py form.\n",
    "- Please format your input and output strings to be user friendly.  For tips on how to do this, see the python string formatting cookbook at: https://mkaz.tech/code/python-string-format-cookbook/.  For example, in the first problem below, format the tip to two decimal places like 15.25 instead of 15.25000001.\n",
    "- Limited user input validation and error checking is encouraged on this assignment. Each question below will indicate the type of input that you can expect. (for example, if the question states the input will be an integer you can expect the user to input an integer and do not need to check to ensure it is an integer versus a float or a string)\n",
    "- Adding comments in your code is strongly suggested but won't be graded.\n",
    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your scripts output the same information.\n",
    "- If you are stuck on a problem or do not understand a question - please come to office hours or ask questions to the class Google group (please don't post your code though). If it is a coding problem send a private email to all of the instructors. "
