    "There are times when we want to exit a loop earlier than we expect. As an example, suppose you want to test if a number, $x$, is prime or not. You could start checking if there are any numbers that are factors of $x$, starting from 2 and counting up. When you leave the loop, you will want to know whether you found any factors of $x$. To do this, you might use a Boolean variable and set it to `False` whenever you find a factor. We might call such a variable a flag; we trip it to store some information we will need later. The following script demonstrates this strategy."
